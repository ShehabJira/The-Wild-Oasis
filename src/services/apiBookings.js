// difference between bookings and stays. In the last month(30 days), we could have 50 bookings, not all of them would get a stay in the same month they will get their stays on a different periods of time, so may be there would be 25 stays in that month and the others would be in the upcoming days or months, and these 25 stays NOT all of them are confirmed because some guests may have got a stay in that month but he has never come to the hotel.
// we could know the number of bookings in the last month by the created_at that has occured in that month, and the stays by the startDate that has occured in that month, and the confirmed stays simply by their start date together with the status of either checked in or checked out.
// So the bookings are the actual sales. So for example, in the last 30 days the hotel might have sold 50 bookings online, but maybe 30 of these guests will only arrive and check into the hotel in the far future like month or even a year after they have booked the booking. Now, on the other hand, we have the stays. So stays are the actual check-ins of guests as they arrive for their bookings in our hotel that we can identify stays simply by their start date together with the status of either checked in or checked out. So again, as a summary, a booking is an actual sale while a stay is a guest actually staying in the hotel.
